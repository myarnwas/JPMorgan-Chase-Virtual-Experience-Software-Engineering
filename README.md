## 🧩 Tasks Covered in This Project

During the virtual experience, I worked on the following key tasks:

- ✅ Setting up a high-profile, high-stakes project
- ✅ Integrating Apache Kafka for real-time stream processing
- ✅ Integrating an H2 in-memory database with Spring Boot
- ✅ Connecting to an external REST API using Spring's RestTemplate
- ✅ Exposing a REST API endpoint via a Spring Boot controller

## 💡 Notes

- All tasks were implemented and tested locally using Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, and H2 Database.
- This implementation is independent and original, based on the requirements provided by the virtual internship.
- The goal was to complete all tasks with working, testable code and demonstrate backend development skills.
